  <p>
    These rules are designed to help our community and keep everyone safe. Failure to read them is <strong>NOT AN EXCUSE</strong> and will most likely result in punishment.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1: Core</h2>
    <p>These are the non-negotiables. They apply everywhere — Minecraft, Discord, and beyond. If you can't follow these, you do not belong in our community.</p>
    <h3>1.1: Respect</h3>
    <p>Treat all players and staff with basic decency. Hate speech, slurs, personal attacks, or any form of targeted harassment is not tolerated — even if disguised as a joke or using emojis. We know what you mean.</p>

    <h3>1.2: Discrimination</h3>
    <p>Any kind of racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or similar behavior is absolutely intolerable and will result in an immediate ban — no warnings, no debates.</p>

    <h3>1.3: Toxicity</h3>
    <p>Don’t go out of your way to provoke, troll, or ruin someone else’s experience. If you're only here to cause drama or push boundaries, you are not welcome.</p>

    <h3>1.4: Common Sense</h3>
    <p>If you think “Can I say this and technically not break the rules?” — you have already answered your own question. If it feels wrong, do not do it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2: Fair Play</h2>
    <p>We play fair, or we don’t play at all. If you’re looking to cheat, exploit bugs, or gain unfair advantages in other ways — find another server.</p>
    <h3>2.1: Unfair Advantages</h3>
    <p>Hacked clients, macros, auto-clickers, unfair mods, exploits, and in some cases bug abusing, are not allowed. If you're unsure if something is allowed, ask our staff members first.</p>

    <h3>2.2: Bugs/Glitches</h3>
    <p>Found a bug? Report it. Don’t use it to gain an advantage, to disrupt gameplay or anything else.</p>

    <h3>2.3: PvP</h3>
    <p>No cross-teaming in any modes and no targeting. Use skill, not shady and/or annoying tactics.</p>

    <h3>2.4: Alt Accounts</h3>
    <p>Alt accounts are allowed <em>within reason</em> — like starting fresh with new stats. They are strictly prohibited if used to bypass punishments.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3: Chat & Communication</h2>
    <p>Our chats (Minecraft and Discord) should be fun and safe for everyone. Don't make them toxic.</p>
    <h3>3.1: Keep it Clean</h3>
    <p>Excessive swearing, sexual content, graphic topics, or edgy “jokes” aren’t welcome here.</p>

    <h3>3.2: Spam</h3>
    <p>This includes repeated messages, emoji spam, copypasta, mic spam, or soundboards in voice chat.</p>

    <h3>3.3: Inappropriate Content</h3>
    <p>This applies to profile pics, usernames, nicknames, links, and media. Keep it safe for all ages.</p>

    <h3>3.4: Topic</h3>
    <p>Use the right channels for the right things. Don't turn every chat into your personal soapbox.</p>
	
	<h3>3.5: Controversial & Sensitive Topics</h3>
    <p>Politics, religion, drama, or hot takes — take them somewhere else, this is not the place for it.</p>
	
	<h3>3.6: Impersonation</h3>
    <p>Don't pretend to be staff, other players, or public figures. It’s not funny, and it’s not allowed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4: Staff & Authority</h2>
    <p>We’re here to keep the server safe and fun. Respect that, even if you don’t agree.</p>
    <h3>4.1: Respect all staff decisions</h3>
    <p>If a staff member tells you to stop — stop. Arguing in chat won’t help your case.</p>

    <h3>4.2: Appeals & Complaints</h3>
    <p>If you feel something was unfair, make a ticket. Don’t cause drama in public chats and don't DM staff members unless they specifically tell you to.</p>

    <h3>4.3: Don't "mini-mod"</h3>
    <p>Let staff handle rule enforcement. Reporting is helpful, backseat moderating isn’t.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5: External Content & Links</h2>
    <p>Don’t use our platforms to promote your stuff unless you have permission. Simple as that.</p>
    <h3>5.1: Advertisement</h3>
    <p>This includes promoting other Minecraft servers, Discords, streams, or channels. Unless you've been given permission, it's not allowed.</p>

    <h3>5.2: Links</h3>
    <p>Random links, invite codes, or shady redirects will get deleted — and possibly you too.</p>

    <h3>5.3: Privacy</h3>
    <p>Do not share personal information — yours or anyone else’s. This includes real names, addresses, social media, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6: Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p>By using any part of the Gato Network — Minecraft, Discord, or anything else — you agree to follow not just our rules, but also the global ones that keep platforms safe.</p>
    <h3>6.1: Discord Terms of Service and Community Guidelines</h3>
    <p>You must follow Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times. Breaking these can result in account bans — from Discord itself, not just us.</p>

    <h3>6.2: Minecraft's EULA (End User License Agreement)</h3>
    <p>All gameplay must follow the Minecraft End User License Agreement. No real-money trades, no selling accounts, no shady business.</p>

    <h3>6.3: Local Laws</h3>
    <p>Just because you’re online <strong>does not mean you’re above the law.</strong> Illegal activity (threats, doxxing, scams, etc.) will be reported to proper authorities if necessary.</p>

    <h3>6.4: Age Requirement</h3>
    <p>You must be 13+ to use Discord. If you're underage, you will be removed in order to comply with platform rules.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Additionally:</h2>
  <p>By participating in this community — whether in Minecraft or on Discord — you agree to follow all rules listed here, even if you disagree with them.</p>
  <p>Rules may be updated over time. When they are, we’ll ping you — but it's your responsibility to read and understand them. Saying you “didn’t know” won’t get you out of trouble.</p>
  <p>We do our best to keep the Gato Network Community safe, but we can’t guarantee complete protection from scams, cheats, or account theft. Use common sense, stay alert, and report anything suspicious to help us protect the community.</p>
